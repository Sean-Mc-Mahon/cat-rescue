## Project Overview

Phibsboro Cat Rescue is a site where cat fosterers can create profiles for cats in their care to be viewed by potential adopters. PCR is a real charity which I am a member of as a fosterer. The flow of data in the organisation is a complicated system of social media, emails spreadsheets and folders and I aim to simplify this process.

## UX Planes



### Strategy Plane

#### Project Goals:

- 
- 
- 

#### User Goals:

- 
- 
- 
- 

#### Personal Goals

- To learn and practice frontend and backend programming together for the first time. To combine the use of HTML, CSS, Materialize and JavaScript with Python, MongoDB, Flask and Jinja.

### Scope Plane



### Structure Plane



### Skeleton Plane

- Nav Bar: 
- Main: 
- Footer: Displays copyright information and provides links to social pages.

Each page may be navigated to eachother with one click.

### Surface Plane

#### Design

A standard layout is fully responsive on mobile devices and larger screens.

#### Color Scheme

Color scheme is based on existing PCR branding and my color scheme can be found on my Coolors profile: [Coolors](https://coolors.co/u/sean_mcmahon)

![Color Palette]()

#### Typography

2 [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used across the site:

- [Lily Script One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lily+Script+One?query=lily) : Logo & Headings, used for it's bold style.
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montse) : Body, used for it's excellent readability.

Font sizes for the headings are mostly responsive using the calc() function.

#### Media

All images, models and featured products are the authors own. Logos are also produced by the author.

#### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq and figma to create the wireframes. The layout has altered since I created the wireframes as I decided against displaying all pages along side each other on the home page.

### Problems and Solutions

-

### Validators

1. **HTML:** [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Used to identify HTML errors.

2. **CSS:** [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Used to identify CSS errors.

3. **Javascript:** [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) Used to identify Javascript errors.

### Manual Testing

1. **Developer Tools:** Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge web dev tools using iPhone 5 and Ipad as toggle devices to test responsiveness.

2. **Lighthouse:** A number of issues were resolved using lighthouse.

3. **Mobile Devices:** I used my Google Pixel 3a phone and Amazon Fire tablet to test the site.

4. **amiresponsive:** [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) Used to test responsiveness across a range of devices.

5. **Friends and family:** I asked for feedback from friends and family in order to get a users perspective.

6. **Contact Form:** On the contact page the form may not be submitted without using correct syntax for the e-mail input or if either input is blank. Once inputs are filled properly and submit is clicked the form will clear without the page being refreshed and an alert will inform user that the message has been sent.

9. **Navigation:** Clicked through all links to ensure they all go to the correct location.

## Deployment

CHANGE DEBUG=TRUE TO FALSE IN APP.PY PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT

1. I Created a Github account at https://github.com
   My account url; https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon

2. I installed Git and set up a username and password.

3. I created a repository on Github (https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/cat-rescue)

4. On VS Code I opened the command pallette and selected Git Clone, I pasted in the URL for the repo on GitHub and selected a folder on my computer to sync to.

5. I uploaded all files to my Github repository.

6. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages. Under the Source setting, I used the drop-down menu to select master branch as a publishing source and saved it. Refreshed the github page, and you are then given a url where your page is published;
   Your site is published at https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/

7. To run this code on a local machine, you would go to my respository at
   https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/cat-rescue and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
   "Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
   To continue with cloning, you would;

- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/ Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
